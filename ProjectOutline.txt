### Project Outline: Analyzing Louisville Crime Data involving Teenagers

I. Introduction
    1.  Objective: By following the few details available in Louisville teen arrest reports for serious crimes like assaults, homicides, gun possessions, etc., understanding the demographic of those arrested to support organizations tasked with descreasing violence among young age groups. 
    2.  Tools and Technologies: Pandas, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public. 
    3.  Goals: 
        - Perform statistical analysis of teens arrested for gun possessions
        - Make findings clear and concise 
        - Contextualizing and visualizing the problem of teens crime in Louisville 

II. Visual Appeal and Design Consistency 
    a. Understanding the Problem
        1. Arrest reports show how many kids have been added to the system for serious crimes. This data explores trends in age, gender and other demographics for organizations to find better ways to address the root of the problem. 
        2. Geographical information to help people visualize and conceptualize this project
    b. Design framework
        1. Font/Color Palette - matching station branding (blues, whites, video industry standards)
        2. Text Accuracy: Language, vocabulary and spelling checks throughout. 

III. Data Acquisition and Cleaning 
    a. Loading Data 
        1. Read into two data files: Requested and loaded records of kids aged 13 to 17 arrested from January 2023 to Decemeber 2023 and demographic data of the teens arrested for gun possession (excel)
    b. Data Cleaning and Merging 
        1. Cleaned the column names up in Mac Pages, noted places with missing data, narrow and maintained the focus of the project in this process.
        2. Explored and played around with data in various sheets to learn more about my data
        3. Merge data on the arrest records to count offenders and people may be charged with more than one crime.
        4. Calculate new data like the demographics of age groups arrested for gun possession. 


IV. Data Analysis and Visualization 
    a. Visualizations 
        1. Create a Tableau dashboard to display data showing:
