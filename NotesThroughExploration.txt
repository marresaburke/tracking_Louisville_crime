Here"s are the notes I will keep as I explore the data and theories to try later

I started by getting my self familiar with the data. Trying to figure out and rationalize what the data's coding system and how this would play into how I explore and manipulate the data. 
Cleaning up the Columns - each included "Arrest" some multiple times.

Figuring out how all my computer, github and visual code work together is rewarding. 

When playing around with grouping dates, I realized I may be looking at how many teens were arrested on a particular day. 
Leading the question, what may have been going on to cause such large arrest on particular days? 
Between two days in August of 2023, over 150 teenagers were arrested by LMPD. What was going on? 

I decided to investigate and see how many unique values are there and it confirms 80 is an anonomal. * 


Looking age ages, the age.value_counts tells me the how many of each age group were arrested. 

*Can I figure out what charges are popular per age group?  

379 kids arrested for recieving stolen property 10K or more. 
298 kids arrested for possession of a handgun first offense. 

lambda (gun) looking for how many teen got a gun charge 


Area of interest - Map of area, county outlined in red, context of the story, 
what about it there is different? sateline image boundaries. Contextualizing. 

interview data - story that goes on with a story point. 

expand on what things mean.
